### Getting Started

Installation Steps of Node and NPM in Windows
Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) for downloading node

```
> Download the Windows installer from the Nodes.js® web site.
> Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)
> Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).
> Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js® until you restart your computer.
```

Test it in Windows!
```
> Test Node: To see if Node is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type node -v. This should print a version number, so you’ll see something like this v0.10.35.
> Test NPM: To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal. This should print NPM’s version number so you’ll see something like this 1.4.28
```

Install Node.js on Ubuntu
```
> $ sudo apt-get update
> $ sudo apt-get install nodejs
> $ sudo apt-get install npm
> To check which version of Node.js you have installed after these initial steps, type:
> $ node -v
> To check which version of NPM you have installed after these initial steps, type:
> $ npm -v
